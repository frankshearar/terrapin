Terrapin is a series of experiment in exploring functions of one complex variable.

* moebius.html maps a grid in the z plane onto the w plane demonstrating Moebius transformations (also known as linear fractional transformations).

Future experiments:
* Generalise moebius to arbitrary complex functions (watch for cuts).
* The idea is that, given a function z: C -> C, you move a turtle in the z plane. At the same time, terrapin maps the turtle's trajectory, displaying the resulting w plane.
